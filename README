quizbot
=======

quizbot is an IRC quiz bot, used for online quizzes and fun+learning activities. The bot also can make basic converation.
It's a combination of two components, both of which have been significantly enhanced by me.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
quizbot builds upon a skeleton quizbot at https://github.com/plaimi/q/blob/master/q
The chat component is a much enhanced version of https://github.com/jezhiggins/eliza.py
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Use
===

Hack config.py. 
questions are in questions.py, as per the format. 

Start the bot with:
	$ ./q
or:
	$ python q


Dependencies
============

quizbot is written in Python and runs on the 2.7 interpreter. The dependencies 
below are listed with the oldest versions that are confirmed to work. Older 
versions *might* work. 

-python 2.7.x
-twisted >= 11.0.0
-twisted-words >= 11.0.0

A Note on Python 3
------------------

The 3.x interpreter will try to run this and fail. You *need* to use a 2.x 
interpreter (2.7.x is the only one with which quizbot is formally tested). 
This may be accomplished by specifically invoking a 2.x interpreter on some 
systems.
        $ python2 q


Contributing To the Project
===========================

Yes, please. 

quiz -
- Improve the way question-answer pairs are stored. (Please provide code to
  convert the current structure for me to test it.)
- Write better algorithms for detecting answers.
- Make quizbot reconnect correctly when it loses its IRC connection.
- Allow submitting questions to the bot itself
- Allow only one answer per quizzer.

chats -
- More than a single line responses from the bot
- Initiate converations instead of just responding
- More and more regexes , because they lead to less duplication of responses.

Try to keep the source very short. Please take some time to come up with the
shortest readable and logical solution to what you are trying to do. 

Send me a pull-request using Github or an email to nkshirsagar@gmail.com

Happy hacking!

To get the bot working, you might need to do all this:
pip install colorama
pip install termcolor
pip install pyfiglet
yum install python27-python-pip -y
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install twisted
yum install python2-devel
might need to change include path to get twisted to compile and find python.h
